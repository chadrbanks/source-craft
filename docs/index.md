## Welcome

Thank you for checking out Source Craft.
Source craft is more of a religion than a game or belief.
But it is not like a centralized or organized religion. 
It is meant to provide more of an open framework for individuals to build a life of purpose for themselves.


## About

Source work is all about energy or vibes.
It comes from an individual entity understanding that we all share the same conciousness, and are just limited by our physical pressence here.

## Hypothesis

Similar to how the cells that make up our bodies eventually learned to work together to live their best life, mankind must do the same.
This framework should allow each individual to experiement and discover thier innerself, and control thier energies.

## Dedication

Source Craft is dedicated to the forces that watch over and guide us, however we may envision or name them.
